# JavaScript Code Quiz
The purpose of creating a timed quiz through the browser is to not only demonstrate my skills and knowledge on JavaScript to construct the application, but to also use this quiz as a future resource to review JavaScript fundamentals. This application was created with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The content of the page has a start button, a timer, and questions on the screen. When the timer is over, the user will see what score they received after answering the questions on the screen. The deployed application can be found here: https://codeandlift706.github.io/JavaScript-Code-Quiz/.


## Installation
VS Code to create and manipulate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the application through the web browser. GitHub for version control and web page deployment.
