## Description
The purpose of creating a timed quiz through the browser is to use this as a future resource to review JavaScript fundamentals. This application was created with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. On click, users will answer a series of questions and try to gain as many points before the timer runs out or before the end of the quiz. Points will be deducted if the user selects the wrong answer. When the timer is over, users can see their final score and submit their score and initials to the scoreboard. The deployed application can be found here: https://codeandlift706.github.io/JavaScript-Code-Quiz/.

## Installation
VS Code to create and manipulate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the application through the web browser. GitHub for version control and web page deployment.

## Usage
This can be used as a quiz template for any subject.
